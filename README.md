[![Docker Build Status](https://img.shields.io/docker/cloud/build/niclaslindstedt/docker-backup.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/niclaslindstedt/docker-backup/builds/)
[![Docker Automated build](https://img.shields.io/docker/cloud/automated/niclaslindstedt/docker-backup.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/niclaslindstedt/docker-backup/)

Backs up your Docker volumes and/or data folders and stores them both short-term and long-term. Prune old backups after X days or when free space gets tight.

**CAUTION: Do not use this for production environments. It has not been thorougly tested yet.**

## Features

- Cron for precise backup schedules.
- Backup any folder or Docker volume on your host machine.
- Easily restore backups.
- Pause your other Docker containers during backup/restoration to prevent invalid states.

## Instructions

1. Mount all volumes you want backed up in `/volumes`
2. Mount the short-term backup location in `/backup`
3. Mount the long-term storage location in `/lts`

See the [Use cases wiki page](https://github.com/niclaslindstedt/docker-backup/wiki/Use-cases) for more advanced use cases.

# Docker Backup

Backs up your Docker volumes and/or data folders and stores them both short-term and long-term. Purge old backups after X days or when free space gets tight.

## Features

* Cron for precise backup schedules.
* Backup any folder or Docker volume on your host machine.
* Easily restore a backup.
* Stop your other Docker containers during backup/restoration to prevent invalid states.

## Instructions

1. Mount all volumes you want backed up in `/volumes`
2. Mount the short-term backup location in `/backup`
3. Mount the long-term storage location in `/lts`

Backup your Docker volumes and/or data folders and store them both short-term and long-term. Prune unwanted backups according to precise pruning settings, or when free space gets tight.

**CAUTION: Do not use this for production environments. It has not been thorougly tested yet.**

## Features

- Backup any Docker volume or folder on your host machine.
- Easily restore backups with one command.
- Encrypt your backups for safe storage in the cloud.
- Verify your backups' integrity with sfv checksums.
- Cron scheduling for precise backup schedules.
- Pause your other Docker containers during backup/restoration to prevent invalid states
  - Note: _This is only supported on the `-docker` tagged images._

## Instructions

1. Mount all volumes you want backed up in `/volumes`
2. Mount the short-term backup location in `/backup`
3. Mount the long-term storage location in `/lts`
